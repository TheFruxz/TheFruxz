### Hello there!

My name is Fruxz and I am currently very active in the role of software developer. I've spent what feels like an eternity developing Java, but have recently been drawn to Kotlin and Swift (with SwiftUI) as I've come to really appreciate the style of these programming languages. Unfortunately most of my Kotlin & Swift projects are closed-source, but feel free to check out my current projects and the projects I like to work on. Have fun!
